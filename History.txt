=== 0.7.0 / 2009-07-20

* It is possible to register +post_resolve+ actions via blocks:
  ivy.post_resolve {...}
* support for generic configuration syntax via +method_missing+:
  Any method combination of TARGETS [:compile, :test, :package] and TYPES [:conf, :include, :exclude] is valid.
  It is possible to set all confs at once:
  +ivy.conf :compile => 'conf', :package => 'other', :test => ['still', 'other']
  Or to set the complete package options:
  +ivy.package :conf => 'prod', :include => /includepattern/, :exclude => /excludepattern/+
  Or to set a specific value via a complete call like:
  +ivy.compile_conf [...] or ivy.conf_test [...] or ivy.package.include [...]
* more include/exclude possibilities, support to include and exclude for compile and test targets using
  +ivy.include :compile => [pattern list]+ or +ivy.exclude+
* small refactorings
